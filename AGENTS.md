## AWWAB architecture
- All scoring formulas live in `src/lib/awwab/calc.ts` (pure functions); UI never computes scores — single source of truth per spec.
- Life Score is a non-renormalized sum (domain weight × activity weight × performance), starting at 0; missing data adds 0 but is never a failure, so sparse data cannot inflate it. The progress chart uses `lifeScoreAsOf` (rolling 7 days, entries on/before the date) so later entries never rewrite past days.
- Activity/domain config (`src/lib/awwab/config.ts`) is the only place targets and weights are defined; targets are versioned by `effectiveFrom` so history won't silently change.
- Data persists locally via `src/lib/awwab/store.ts` (raw input only: null = no data, false = not done, 0 = zero); when signed in, `sync.ts` mirrors the whole state as one JSON row per user in `user_state` (account wins on sign-in) — simplest way to keep progress across devices.
- Insights are deterministic (`insights.ts`), never AI.
- Pages render client-side only (AppShell mount gate) because they depend on local date and localStorage.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is off: config lookups by known IDs made it pure noise.
- Cat mascot state comes only from `resolveCatState()` in `src/lib/branding/catStates.ts`, fed by the existing Life Score (current week); `AwwabCat` maps five states to normalized illustration assets, shared with the dynamic favicon to keep branding consistent.
- Planner items (`plannerItems` in AppState, derivations in `src/lib/awwab/planner.ts`) record intention only; they never write tracking entries or feed calc.ts, so plans cannot inflate Life Score.
- Mobile navigation is isolated in `MobileNavigation` with primary links and a controlled overflow popover; desktop navigation remains in AppShell so mobile simplification does not change desktop access.
- Routines (`routines`/`routineExceptions` in AppState, derivations in `src/lib/awwab/routines.ts`) are templates; occurrences are computed, never stored, and per-date exceptions override them. "This and future" edits split the routine at a date so the past is never rewritten; routines never feed calc.ts.
